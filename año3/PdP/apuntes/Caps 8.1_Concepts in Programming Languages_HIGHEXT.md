# Control in Sequential Languages


## STRUCTURED CONTROL


### Spaghetti Code

it is easy to write programs with incomprehensible control structure.


### Structured Control

In the 1960s, programmers began to understand that unstructured jumps could make it difÔ¨Åcult to understand a program.
This led to the development of some constructs that structure jumps:


#### if . . . then . . . else . . . end while . . . do . . . end for . . . { . . . } case . . .\

These are now adopted in virtually all modern languages.

In modern programming style,
we group code in logical blocks,

avoid explicit jumps
and cannot jump into the middle of a block

Simple control structures such as if-then-else have now been in common use since the rise of Pascal in the late 1970s.
